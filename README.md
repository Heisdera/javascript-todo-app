#### Project idea gotten from John Smilga's "Grocery bud project" i did while undergoing his dope javascript course.
#### Summary
On completing this project, I stumbled upon a bug which really messed with my brain after severally trials and visiting google & stackoverflow then I asked my friend @Jerry-Chibuife for help and he worked his magicðŸ˜… and I learnt from his sorceryðŸ˜‡.

Building this project has taught me sometimes it's best to ask for help after I've tried several times and failed to come up with a solution instead of wasting days and time alotted for other projects and I get to learn the solution to my mistakes.
